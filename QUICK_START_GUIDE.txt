1. Install postgres on your device (please use a password that you have never used before and will never use in the future, '1234' for example)
2. Confirm access to postgres
	- Open 'psql shell' and hit enter until you are prompted for your password. Then enter your password.
	- If you see 'postgres=# ' as your command prompt you are in
3. Please run the below commands in postgres
	- 'DATABASE CREATE test_db;'
	- '\\c test_db'
4. Change the 'config.py' file to have your password for postgres
5. Add and run these lines of code in the bottom of 'database_functions.py'
	- temp = DatabaseManager()
	- temp.setup_test_db()
6. Go back to postgres and run the below commands
	- 'SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM Addresses;'
	- 'SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM StateChanges;'
7. If you received an output of a few hundred for the first one and 0 for the second one, then it has worked properly. If you did not get this please retry the above steps.
8. Remove those lines from "database_functions.py"
9. To setup virtual environments please run the below commands
	- 'python3 -m venv venv'
	- Windows:
		- 'venv/Scripts/activate'
		- If this doesn't work:
			- Run windows powershell as admin on your computer
	            - Run 'Set-Executionpolicy unrestricted'
	            - Go back to VS Code and try the command again
	- Mac/Linux:
		- 'chmod +x venv/bin/activate'
		- 'source venv/bin/activate'
10. You should now see a '(venv)' at the front of your command prompt, if not please retry the above steps
11. In the venv please run ''python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt'
12. Run 'web_app.py'
13. Open the website 'http://127.0.0.1:8080'
14. You should now see a website and will be able to follow the prompts as expected!
15. Good luck with the future work!
